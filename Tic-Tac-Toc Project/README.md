Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a simple program that allows you to play Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer. The game follows the following assumptions and rules:

The computer plays with 'X'.
You (the user) play with 'O'.
The computer makes the first move by placing an 'X' in the middle of the board.
The board consists of squares numbered from 1 to 9, row by row.
The user inputs their move by entering the number of the square they choose.
The number must be valid: an integer between 1 and 9, and the square cannot already be occupied.
After each move, the program checks if the game is over: it can continue, end in a tie, or declare a win for you or the computer.
The computer's moves are chosen randomly, without any artificial intelligence.
